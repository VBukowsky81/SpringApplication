# SpringApplication
Spring, Dependency Injection, JPA

Hello, everyone!

I wanted to present this great example, in my opinion, of a basic Enterprise level Spring application, dependency injection and generally Spring Data. Dependency injection sounds really cool, and it IS actually cool. DI is really hard to describe, and I have not heard a good enough SHORT description of it. 

I would say, DI are ways to inject yourself into object creation process. Why do this? Because you can insert/inject all sorts of data automatically/from external sources, for example, before object is created. This DECOUPLES object creation process, and gives you ways to automate it. I am still rather new to this huge area of depenedency injection subject matter.

The idea here is great, if I fully understand it. Mass production of objects, with externally sourced inputs. Profiles, environment variables, special annotations, etc.

I am not taking credit for this work, but I would have build this example exactly the same.

Best Regards,

Vic
